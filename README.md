## Description

This is [Angular](https://angular.io/) form control using [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) styling. It's built with the help of a great [rrule.js](https://github.com/jakubroztocil/rrule) library.

It also uses:
* [lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash)
* [moment](https://github.com/moment/moment)
* [ng-bootstrap](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/components/datepicker/overview)

## Installation and Docs
Rrule is stored always in local timezone. Its best to explicitly specify the timezone in the rrule for reference. If no timezone is specified it can be assumed as UTC.
